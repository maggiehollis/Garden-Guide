      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br />
        Tucked in the heart of Athens, the National Garden is a lush, tranquil escape from the city's vibrant energy. Located just behind the Hellenic Parliament and stretching between Syntagma Square and the Zappeion Hall, this 15.5-hectare public park offers both locals and visitors a chance to slow down, breathe deeply, and wander through a living tapestry of both Mediterranean and exotic plants.
        <br />
        <img src="photos/lush.jpeg" alt="Image of lush greenery" class="center-image" />
        <br />
        Originally commissioned in the 1830s by Queen Amalia — Greece's first queen — the garden was designed to serve as the royal palace's private grounds. Today, it retains much of its romantic, 19th-century charm.
        <br />
        <br />
        With winding paths, shaded benches, ancient ruins, and a small menagerie, the garden provides more than just greenery; it tells a layered story of Greece's history. Whether you're after a peaceful moment or a deeper connection to Athenian culture, the National Garden offers a gentle, grounding experience right in the city's core.

    <div class="tab-content" id="history">
      <h2>History & Background</h2>
      <br />
      The National Garden of Athens, originally known as the Royal Garden, was commissioned by Queen Amalia in 1838 and completed in 1840 by German agronomist Friedrich Schmidt. Queen Amalia was deeply involved in the garden's development, personally overseeing its creation and spending several hours daily tending to it. She introduced the iconic palm trees, now towering at 25 meters, which continue to captivate visitors at the entrance on Vasilissis Amalias Avenue.
      <br />
      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="photos/palm 2.jpeg" alt="Image of Palm Trees" />
        <img src="photos/palm 1.jpeg" alt="Image of Palm Trees" />
      </div>
      <br />
      The garden spans 15.5 hectares and is located in the heart of Athens, adjacent to the Greek Parliament building and extending southward to the Zappeion Hall. It serves as a green oasis amidst the urban landscape, offering a serene retreat for both locals and tourists.
      <br /><br />
      An intriguing historical event associated with the garden is the untimely death of King Alexander in 1920. While walking in the garden, he was bitten by a pet monkey, leading to his demise from sepsis three weeks later. This incident had significant political repercussions, influencing the course of Greek history during that period. These included the abdication of his father, King Constantine I, and the eventual establishment of the Second Hellenic Republic.
      <br /><br />
      In 1923, the garden was officially renamed the National Garden of Athens and opened to the public. This symbolizes the transition from monarch to a more inclusive society. Today, the National Garden stands as a testament to Athens' rich history and biodiversity, featuring preserved ancient ruins and Roman mosaics, diverse plant species, and tranquil pathways that invite exploration and reflection.

      <h2>Design Elements</h2>
      <h3>Layout & Design</h3>
      The National Garden is designed in a romantic, picturesque style and is typical of 19th-century European landscape architecture. The layout emphasizes naturalistic aesthetics — curved pathways, hidden corners, and carefully layered vegetation create a peaceful, immersive environment ideal for quiet exploration or relaxed wandering.
      <br />
      <img src="photos/paths.jpeg" alt="Image of paths" class="center-image" />

      <h3>Pathways & Circulation</h3>
      The park is crisscrossed by meandering gravel paths, some broad and busy, while others are narrower and more intimate. These pathways weave through dense plantings and open lawns, encouraging exploration and offering ever-changing perspectives of the garden. There is no rigid or formal geometry here — just gentle curves and frequent forks in the path that allow visitors to “choose their own adventure.”
      <br /><br />
      Signage is minimal, which enhances the feeling of organic discovery. Several entrances — most notably on Vasilissis Amalias Avenue and near the Zappeion Hall — allow for easy access from various parts of the city center.

      <h3>Plant Choices & Vegetation</h3>
      The garden is home to over 500 species of plants, including both native Mediterranean plants and exotic imports. Notable species include:
      <ul>
        <li> Tall Washingtonia palm trees (planted by Queen Amalia herself) which frame the main entrance.</li>
        <li> Jacarandas, oleanders, cypresses, and olive and orange trees.</li>
        <li> Dense hedges and climbing plants like ivy and bougainvillea.</li>
        <li> A small botanical section displays labeled plant specimens.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="photos/orange trees.jpeg" alt="Image of orange tree" class="center-image" />
      
      <h3>Water Features</h3>
      There are several small ponds and fountains throughout the garden, which act as focal points and provide habitats for ducks and turtles. These water features are often surrounded by stone seating or shaded areas and add a soothing element to the environment.
      <br />

        <img src="photos/water 3.jpeg" alt="Image of water feature"/>
      </div>
      <br />
      In many of the ponds you can find koi fish as well. One particularly charming pond is located near the children's library and small zoo, where ducks often paddle across the surface or rest nearby.

      <h3>Seating & Relaxation Areas</h3>
      Throughout the garden, you’ll find a mix of:
      <ul>
        <li> Simple wooden and stone benches.</li>
        <li> Pergolas and vine-covered arches.</li>
        <li> Open grassy lawns where visitors can sit or lie down (though not all areas are designated for lounging).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reflections & Value</h2>
      <br />
      When exploring the gardens I felt a sense of tranquility come over me as the hustle and bustle of the city disappeared. The greenery and wildlife that fill the space create a peaceful atmosphere that is both calming and wholly unique to Greece (where else are you going to see turtles, chamoises/goats, ducks, and cats wandering among ancient ruins and orange trees?)
      <br />
      <img src="photos/cat.jpeg" alt="Image of cat" class="center-image" />
      <br />
      The importance of this garden is evident in its ability to provide a natural escape in the heart of a bustling city. It offers a space for locals and tourists to relax, exercise, and connect with nature. The garden's historical significance, as well as its role in preserving biodiversity and providing educational opportunities, further underscore its value to the community.
